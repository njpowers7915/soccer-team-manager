# soccer-team-manager


Inspired by the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Soccer Team Manager is a Sinatra App that allows a manager to
edit his team's roster and edit information about players on his/her team.  The logged in user also has the ability
to view information about other teams and other players.

## Installation

To use this app, simply clone, run rake db:migrate and then run shotgun. Everything should be set up.
